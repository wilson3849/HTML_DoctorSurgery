                Self-help therapies are psychological therapies that you can do in your own time to help with problems like stress, anxiety and depression.<br />
                They can be a useful way to try out a therapy like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to see if it's for you.<br />
                They can also be convenient if:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>you're short of time</li>
                    <li>you have family or work commitments</li>
                    <li>you cannot get out easily</li>
                </ul>
                If you do not feel better after trying a self-help therapy, there are other things you can try, like a type of talking therapy.<br />
                Our psychological therapies service can tell you more.<br />

                Your doctor may decide to issue you with repeat prescriptions.<br />
                In this practice medical records are computerised, and your regular medication will be listed.<br />
                Patients will be issued with a printed prescription which is signed by the doctor and a printed copy, which is then used to re-order medications. Please tick the items you require. If a medicine you normally take is not on your prescription copy please print the name and dose in block letters.<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>We are unable to take requests for repeat prescriptions over the telephone.</li>
                    <li>Please allow 48 hours for the prescriptions to be processed.</li>
                </ul>
                Prescriptions may be posted back to you – please remember to include a stamped addressed envelope and allow extra time for postage.<br />
                Prescriptions are sent electronically to a pharmacy of your choice.<br />
                Repeat prescriptions need to be reviewed on a regular basis and the doctor may request to see you in order to update your medication list and carry out annual health checks.<br />
                Please make your prescription requests in writing<br />
                Repeat requests – Please allow 48 hours, excluding weekends and Bank Holidays, for your request to be processed. Any problems please telephone the surgery.<br />
