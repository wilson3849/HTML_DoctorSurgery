        <p>Self-help therapies are psychological therapies that you can do in your own time to help with problems like stress, anxiety and depression.</p>
        <p>They can be a useful way to try out a therapy like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to see if it's for you.</p>
        <p>They can also be convenient if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>you're short of time</li>
            <li>you have family or work commitments</li>
            <li>you cannot get out easily</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you do not feel better after trying a self-help therapy, there are other things you can try, like a type of talking therapy.</p>
        <p>Our psychological therapies service can tell you more.</p>

        <p>Patients will be issued with a printed prescription which is signed by the doctor and a printed copy, which is then used to re-order medications. Please tick the items you require. If a medicine you normally take is not on your prescription copy please print the name and dose in block letters.</p>
        <ul>

        <p>Prescriptions are sent electronically to a pharmacy of your choice.</p>
        <p>Repeat prescriptions need to be reviewed on a regular basis and the doctor may request to see you in order to update your medication list and carry out annual health checks.</p>
        <p>Please make your prescription requests in writing</p>
